                <h1>Warcross</h1>
                <p>
                    I found Warcross to be a highly intriguing and engaging novel. It challenges us to answer what we
                    value
                    more: our freedom, or our happiness. The story of Emika, a young hacker who finds herself happier
                    than
                    she‚Äôs ever been before surrounded by a world of richness and splendor relates to me like very few
                    other
                    novels I have read. The appeal of this novel only increases with the fact that I am also a
                    programmer,
                    and although the portrayal of code and programming in this novel is laughable at best, even in an
                    advanced science-fiction world, the message of the novel still shines through. After this novel, I
                    began
                    to consider how anything significant I was working on, or any strong opinions I had would affect
                    other
                    people, and the world. This contemplation has lead me to a few revelations, the clearest one being
                    how
                    often things are a scale rather than a switch. This is easy to say, ‚Äúnot everything is black and
                    white‚Äù,
                    but it is much more difficult to apply this to our lives and spot it in decisions we are making. Far
                    too
                    often, we have to allocate resources to one of a few things, and people will argue about which one
                    of
                    them deserves the majority of the resources, instead of discussing how the resources should be
                    distributed to offer the best performance. I have also seen that this balance has made my life much
                    more
                    successful, because it helps me keep my long terms goals in sight without becoming too distracted by
                    one
                    particular goal.

                <h1>A Letter to My Freshman Self</h1>
                Hello Aanand,
                <p>
                    You are about to embark on one of the most important parts of the development of your personality.
                    You
                    will meet some incredible people, some not so incredible people, some people who will have your back
                    no
                    matter what, and some people who will want to break your back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It‚Äôs exciting, I know! You‚Äôre confident, you have plenty of friends, and you feel like you‚Äôve
                    already
                    figured life out. But you will discover that there‚Äôs a whole lot more to life than that, and you
                    aren‚Äôt
                    as confident as you feel. üòÇ
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will change your friends a few times, until you find people who you can relate to, have fun
                    with,
                    and most importantly, who you can look up to. There‚Äôs so many people you will meet, but they will
                    stick
                    by your side, keep your secrets, and celebrate your accomplishments just as much as you will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will embarrass yourself. A lot. But it‚Äôs okay, that‚Äôs what high school is all about! You can do
                    a
                    lot, just make sure to remember to keep your long terms goals in mind, and buckle up for some of the
                    best years of your life.
                </p>
                Your future self,
                <p>

                <h1>15 Minutes Till Armageddon</h1>
                <p>The following writing piece was a quick story we wrote in AP Language and Composition, in which we
                    wrote out our contingency plan and what we would do if we suddenly became aware that we would die in
                    15 minutes.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I turned the radio up, trying to hear through the static. ‚Äú15 minutes‚Ä¶ nuclear device‚Ä¶ detonate‚Äù.
                        Confused, I switched channels. ‚ÄúLock‚Ä¶ door and windows‚Äù. I switched channels again, ‚Äúnational
                        militia‚Ä¶ all major streets‚Äù. I continued switching channels, but my mind was far away from the
                        incessant buzz and chatter from the tiny radio.</p>
                    <p>I‚Äôd always wondered what I would do, one week, one day, one hour, one minute before death. I
                        guess
                        I‚Äôd call my family, my mom, my dad, my little brother. Then my closest friends. Miss2,
                        California,
                        Golf Loser. It was months ago that I‚Äôd changed their nicknames in my phone. Then I‚Äôd wait. There
                        was
                        nothing more to do, was there?</p>
                    <p>It seemed funny now. Everything meant nothing. Every second spent studying, every minute gone
                        reading, every hour wasted learning, every day left behind in the woods, every week thrown away
                        my
                        family. Every laugh, every memory, every hug, every kiss. Every ancient story, every discovery,
                        every invention. Everything meant nothing, not now.</p>
                    <p>I didn‚Äôt want to call anyone. It would‚Äôve been pointless. I pushed open the door and tiptoed down
                        my
                        driveway. The sun was setting, painting the sky shades of pink and purple. My solid red pajamas
                        made
                        me stick out like the bristles of a dry paintbrush, but who cared? I certainly didn‚Äôt. I
                        chuckled as
                        I walked down the street.</p>
                    <p>My phone rang. ‚ÄúMom is calling‚Äù it screamed to nobody in particular. I extended my arm out and
                        dropped it, and it went flying off into the distance. A few seconds later, some glass shattered
                        and
                        a car alarm went off. Pain shot up my leg and through my brain. I‚Äôd broken my foot. I began to
                        laugh. Nobody would do anything. It didn‚Äôt matter. I knew what I had to do.</p>
                    <p>I looked at my foot. Ants began to crawl up my leg. Idiots. They were still marching, mindlessly
                        looking for something to eat, even in the last few minutes of their pathetic life. I shook them
                        off
                        and strode away. A cat ran up a tree, and a few minutes later an elderly woman came panting by,
                        wailing for it to come down. I told her to shut up and stomped off, swearing as a branch hit me
                        in
                        the head.</p>
                    <p>Soon, I found what I was looking for. The massive skyscrapers stretched out into the abyss, cars
                        stopped as people finally got the message, and lights turned off one by one as they prepared for
                        The
                        End. It was kind of picturesque, in a grotesque way. I picked up a handful of rocks out of the
                        blue
                        river and began throwing them at the yellow uniforms. Miss. Miss again. Again, I missed. I
                        finally
                        nailed one, and he fell down, unconscious, solid red blood pouring out of his head like paint.
                        Lucky
                        bastard. He wouldn‚Äôt be there for The End. I stepped out from behind the tank and began to dance
                        around in my perverted glee. ‚ÄúHands up!‚Äù they yelled. I obliged, flipping them the finger. They
                        hadn‚Äôt touched, wouldn‚Äôt touch, couldn‚Äôt touch me. I‚Äôd conquered it.</p>
                    <p>I was galloping wildly now, out of control, staring death in the face. What a hero would give for
                        this, face to face with the monster, spitting in its face without fear. Nothing, I supposed,
                        they
                        didn‚Äôt have anything. The world was growing, shrinking, shaking and swirling, still, colorfully
                        monotone. Suddenly it turned sideways, and everything was white once again.</p>
